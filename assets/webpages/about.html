        <h3>WebmarX? What is it again?</h3>
        <p>Glad you asked! Once upon a time there lived.. ohh wait wrong story <br /> <br> Well, there ain't much story to
            this as WebmarX was created out of frustration. I mean, I visit GAZILLION
            websites on the internet and you know what, I've this weird hobby of bookmarking every good website that I
            visit.
            So what is my first world problem you ask? Well, all the browsers that I use (Not talking about you,
            'chrome') do not support cross browser bookmark sharing. Although they do offer sync facility accross the
            same
            browser for different platforms but not for different browsers </p>
        <h3>So What's the point? What exactly is WebmarX doing to solve cross browser bookmark support issue?</h3>
        <p>WebmarX is here to serve you exactly what you need(Nah! not talking about gifting 10 shares of MRF duh!).
            Since WebmarX is a Web App, you won't have to worry about cross browsers and other hectic stuff. Just create
            your account and start bookmarking on the go </p>
